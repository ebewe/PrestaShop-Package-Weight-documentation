PrestaShop Module - Package Weight
==================================

The PrestaShop Module - **Package Weight** - allows you to add a weight for the package of each one of your carriers.

For now the module is only available for PrestaShop 1.6.

It is easy to install and configure. This documentation will explain you how to do that.
